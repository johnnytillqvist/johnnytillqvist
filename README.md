Hey, I'm Johnny.

I have been working in the tech space since 2009. In late 2022, I enrolled in a Data Analytics Program at CareerFoundry to enhance my knowledge of data. Throughout the program, I gained proficiency in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. However, Python captured my interest the most. Below are some of the projects I tinkered around with.
